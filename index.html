                My focus is on full-stack programming for web and mobile applications 
                as well as user experience and building a scalable infrastructure.
                I am currently working as Backend Engineer at <a href="http://badgeville.com">Badgeville</a>.
                My interests extend into machine learning, big data analysis, public speaking, 
                productivity and scientific research.

                I have a Bachelor in Computer Science from the 
                <a href="http://www.tum.de/en/homepage/">Technical University  Munich</a> (TUM)
                as well as a Masters in Software Management from 
                <a href="http://cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>.
                I co-founded the startup <a href="http://comicbin.net">ComicBin</a>,
                a subscription site for digital comics,
                where I was in charge of everything on the technical side, including
                implementing the complete website, iOS app and the comic processing pipeline.
                In my free time I am a passionate photographer and daydreamer 
                looking for the next big thing to make our lives easier.

                I am based in Mountain View, CA, in the heart of the Silicon Valley. 
                I am looking for new ideas, like-minded people to discuss them, 
                seasoned entrepreneurs and investors as well as
                fellow photographers and models that enjoy spontaneous and fun shootings.
